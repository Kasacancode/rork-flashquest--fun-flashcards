Gamified Flashcards. Competitive Learning. Real Progress.

FlashQuest is a mobile learning app that turns flashcards into a competitive game. Instead of passive studying, users train decks, track stats, and enter head-to-head “duels” designed to reinforce recall under pressure.

Built with Expo + React Native + TypeScript, FlashQuest is structured for scalability, persistence, and future multiplayer expansion.
